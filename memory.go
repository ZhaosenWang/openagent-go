// The legacy monolithic Memory interface has been split (P2, Context
// Architecture): short-term conversation storage lives in
// session.SessionStore, token-budget compression in session.Compressor,
// and durable knowledge in provider/memory.MemoryProvider. The root
// package keeps only the shared types below.

// CompressedContext bundles a summary with retrieval hints for the model.
type CompressedContext struct {

	// ThroughIndex marks how many messages have been covered by this summary.
	// The next compression pass only compresses messages after this index.
	// 0 means no compression has occurred (or the summary was produced by
	// an older version that didn't track this value).
}

// SafeCompressionBoundary adjusts the overflow index so compression doesn't
// break tool_call/tool_result pairs. If the last message in the compression
// range is an assistant with tool_calls, the boundary extends forward to
// include all consecutive tool results so the summary captures the complete
// tool exchange. all is in chronological order.
//
// Returns the adjusted overflow index (may be larger than input).
